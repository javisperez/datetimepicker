datetimepicker
==============

A very basic datetime-picker jquery plugin

I made this plugin because i needed a very basic datetime-picker, not just date.

I've tested with jQuery UI one, but for my purpose, it was too complicated, too big, too many files.

So i decided to make a very basic one, a really minimalistic, with simple design and good functionality.

I havent found all bugs yet, but if you see any please let me know, i'll be happy to fix it.

Also, if you need any new functionality or something that this plugin currently doesnt support, feel free to fork it and let me know i'd love to check it out!

For any information, please feel free to mail me : me@javisperez.com
